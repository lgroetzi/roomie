			<h2>The Location</h2>
			<h6>It's <b>the most</b> convenient place I've ever lived. The <b>West 4th</b> subway stop (A, C, E, B, D, F, M) is a one minute walk from the apartment. The 1 train is also very close.</h6>
			<h6>Macdougal is an incredible street to live on - any type of food you could ever want, tons of places to see comedy shows or live music.</h6>
			<h6>If you stand in the middle of the street outside the apartment, you can see the Freedom Tower on one end and Empire State on the other. It's pretty epic, unless you get hit by a taxi.</h6>

Also, my roommate is happy to sell her bed and matress to whoever moves in to the room, so you won't need to move your bed in (unless you'd prefer to do that). She bought both the bed and the mattress in October, so they are almost brand new. Both bedrooms are set back from the street away from any outside noise.</h4>
