			<h2>The Location</h2>
			<h6>It's <b>the most</b> convenient place I've ever lived. The <b>West 4th</b> subway stop (A, C, E, B, D, F, M) is a one minute walk from the apartment. The 1 train is also very close.</h6>
			<h6>Macgoudal is an incredible street to live on - any type of food you could ever want, tons of places to see comedy shows or live music.</h6>
			<h6>If you stand in the middle of the street outside the apartment, you can see the Freedom Tower on one end and Empire State on the other. It's pretty epic, unless you get hit by a taxi.</h6>
